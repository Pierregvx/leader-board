# brigdooor stats 
this project enables the user to participate in a friendly competition : each one of them earn some xps when interacting with the contract that enables them to climb into the leaderboard.

## the graph 
The datas are collected from the bridge contract on arbitrum thanks to the graph.
The graph is hosted on the hosted service  [here](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/pierregvx/arbithack)
### Update the schema or the subgraph :```graph codegen```
### Deploy the subgraph ``` graph deploy```

## Dune dashboard
